# Refined Skin pH Tracking Protocol  
Swab–PBS–Electrode Method | AD1131B Compatible

## Goal
Track relative skin pH changes over time with improved precision using a DIY-compatible, evidence-informed swab protocol.

---

## Materials Required

- AD1131B pH electrode
- 1.5 mL sterile Eppendorf tubes (low-retention)
- Sterile PBS (pH 7.4)
- Sterile cotton swabs
- Micropipette (10–100 µL)
- Nitrile gloves
- Certified pH buffer solutions (4.00, 7.00)
- Distilled/deionized water
- Vortex mixer (e.g., 2000 rpm)
- 1 cm² plastic template
- Timer, thermometer
- Logbook or spreadsheet

---

## Protocol (5–7 minutes per sample)

### 1. Calibrate Electrode
- Calibrate daily with pH 4.00 and 7.00 buffers
- Rinse with deionized water between steps
- Verify calibration with repeat check

### 2. Prep PBS Tubes
- Label tubes by zone (e.g., L-cheek)
- Add **0.3 mL PBS** using micropipette
- Record PBS temperature
- Measure a blank PBS control (~pH 7.4)

### 3. Collect Skin Sample
- Clean target zone with neutral cleanser, wait 30 min
- Wear gloves
- Place 1 cm² template on skin
- Swab inside template with consistent pressure (50–100 g) for 10 seconds
- Insert swab tip into PBS tube, seal

### 4. Extract pH Signal
- Vortex tube at 2000 rpm for 30 sec
- Remove swab with clean forceps
- Rinse and blot electrode
- Insert into PBS tube (ensure full submersion)
- Wait for pH to stabilize (10–15 sec)
- Record reading

### 5. Log Variables
- Date, time, facial zone
- pH value, PBS temperature
- Notes (products, conditions, etc.)

## Enhancements & Notes

- **0.3 mL PBS** = minimizes dilution
- **Template + timer** = standardizes pressure + surface area
- **Blank PBS check** = confirms buffer integrity
- **Skin prep + rest** = improves consistency
- **ΔpH tracking** = focus on trend, not absolute pH

---

## Limitations

- Indirect method: cannot provide true surface pH
- Electrode drift (±0.05) possible
- Cotton swab material may reduce transfer yield
- Micro pH probes would improve precision (future upgrade)
