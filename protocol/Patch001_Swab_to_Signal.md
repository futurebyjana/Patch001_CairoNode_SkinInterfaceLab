# Patch.001: Swab-to-Signal Protocol  
**Cairo Node – Bedroom Lab v1.0**  
_Tracking stress-induced skin changes through pH latency, lesion mapping and PSS-4 (percieved stress) ._

---

## Objective

To create the first open-source diagnostic interface that links:
- Acne lesion activity
- Skin pH fluctuations (zone-specific)
- Perceived stress (PSS-4) scores  
Into a daily-mapped, time-lagged signal loop.

---

## Equipment


- Sterile swabs or cotton tips
- pH meter
- Beakers (100, 250, 500 mL)
- Gloves
- Ethanol (70%) or alcohol wipes
- Microscope (optional)
- Logging sheets or CSV templates
- micropipette

---

## Daily Protocol (Days 1–7)

### 1. Morning Setup
- Wash hands, wear gloves
- Sanitize workspace with 70% ethanol
- Label 2 Eppendorf tubes:
“Day X – Left Cheek”
“Day X – Right Cheek”
- Pipette 0.3 mL PBS into each tube

 
### 2. Lesion Logging
- Count and record:
- Active lesions (L/R)
- Fading or PIH lesions (L/R)
- Take optional facial zone photo for visual archive


### 3. (Optional) Flora Microscopy
- Prepare smear on slide using swab
- Heat-fix, optionally stain
- Observe under microscope
- Record: morphology, density, symmetry


---

## Logging Per Day

Create a log entry for each day. Include:

- **Date**  
- **Sleep duration (hrs)**  
- **PSS-4 score**  
- **pH values per face zone (T-zone, cheeks, chin)**  
- **Lesion log**  
  - Count of active, fading, and PIH lesions (L/R cheeks)
- **Food/stress notes** (e.g., caffeine, emotional spike)

---

## Analysis Plan (After Day 7)


- Organize by day (Day 1–7 grid)
- Overlay stress scores + pH trends
- Observe:
  - Time-lagged responses post stress spike
- Compare L vs R cheek symmetry

---

## Hypothesis

Stress creates a time-lagged shift in skin’s pH profile and microbiome that manifests ~48–72h later as flare activity. Mapping this shift can enable early intervention diagnostics.
