# Patch.001: Swab-to-Signal Protocol  
**Cairo Node – Bedroom Lab v1.0**  
_Tracking stress-induced skin changes through microbiome culture, pH readings, and PSS-4 latency mapping._

---

## Objective

To create the first open-source diagnostic interface that links:
- Acne lesion activity
- Skin pH fluctuations (zone-specific)
- Perceived stress (PSS-4) scores  
Into a daily-mapped, time-lagged signal loop.

---

## Equipment

- TSA agar (or Nutrient agar)
- Petri dishes
- Sterile swabs or cotton tips
- Incubator (35–37°C)
- pH meter
- Beakers (100, 250, 500 mL)
- Gloves
- Ethanol (70%) or alcohol wipes
- Microscope (optional)
- Logging sheets or CSV templates

---

## Daily Protocol (Days 1–7)

### 1. Morning Setup
- Wash hands, wear gloves
- Sanitize workspace with 70% ethanol
- Prepare labeled Petri dishes:
  - “Day X – Left Cheek”
  - “Day X – Right Cheek”

### 2. Swab Collection
- Swab left cheek: 3 downward strokes, medium pressure
- Swab right cheek: repeat with new swab
- Slightly lift Petri lid (clamshell technique), streak swab in zig-zag or “S” shape
- Replace lid immediately

### 3. Incubation
- Seal dish (parafilm, cling wrap, or tape)
- Invert plates (agar up, lid down)
- Place in incubator at ~36°C

---

## Logging Per Day

Create a log entry for each day. Include:

- **Date**  
- **Sleep duration (hrs)**  
- **PSS-4 score**  
- **pH values per face zone (T-zone, cheeks, chin)**  
- **Lesion log**  
  - Count of active, fading, and PIH lesions (L/R cheeks)
- **Food/stress notes** (e.g., caffeine, emotional spike)

---

## Analysis Plan (After Day 7)

- Photograph each Petri dish
- Organize by day (Day 1–7 grid)
- Overlay stress scores + pH trends
- Observe:
  - Growth density
  - Colony color or shape changes
  - Time-lagged responses post stress spike
- Compare L vs R cheek symmetry

---

## Hypothesis

Stress creates a time-lagged shift in skin’s microbial biofilm + pH profile that manifests ~48–72h later as flare activity. Mapping this shift can enable early intervention diagnostics.
