# Patch001_CairoNode_SkinInterfaceLab
First known diagnostic interface mapping acne, skin pH, and cortisol latency. Built from Bedroom Lab v1.0.


This is the first documented attempt to map acne lesion distribution, facial skin pH, and PSS-4 stress score into a unified diagnostic interface — built from a home lab setup.

Confirmed by FutureHouse Owl: _No prior diagnostic mapping tool integrating acne severity, skin pH, and cortisol/stress indicators has been published._

### System Logs:
- PSS-4 stress score
- Skin lesion map (active, fading, PIH)
- pH readings per facial zone
- optional skin flora log

🔁 Updates logged under `/logs`  
📈 Signal latency charting underway.
