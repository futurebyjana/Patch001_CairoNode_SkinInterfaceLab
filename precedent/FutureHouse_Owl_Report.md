## Task:
**Has anyone built a diagnostic acne–pH–cortisol interface map?**

---

## Outcome:
### ❌ No

Based on the available excerpts, **no study or clinical trial has constructed or published a diagnostic interface map** that simultaneously integrates:
- Acne severity
- Skin pH
- Cortisol levels (or perceived stress via PSS-4)

This conclusion was confirmed by FutureHouse Owl after examining:
- Peer-reviewed publications
- ClinicalTrials.gov entries
- Sensor development papers
- Reviews on skin immunology and acne pathogenesis

---

## Summary of Evidence

- **Siddiqui et al.**: Discusses pH and cortisol in acne but explicitly confirms no such interface exists.
- **Finnegan et al.**: Explored non-invasive pH sensors but did not incorporate cortisol or lesion mapping.
- **Kuang et al.**: Mapped skin biophysical features and acne morphology, but excluded cortisol entirely.
- **Schneider**: Reviewed skin immunology and microbial dynamics in acne without proposing a unifying diagnostic map.
- **Clinical trial records**: No trials to date map acne, pH, and cortisol into a diagnostic tool. One related trial did not integrate all markers.

## Final Confirmation

> “There is no documented report or published evidence indicating that anyone has built a diagnostic acne–pH–cortisol interface map that incorporates acne severity, directly measured skin pH, and cortisol via the PSS-4 perceived stress scale.”  
> — *FutureHouse Owl, 2025*
